# Project-3
This is our third project at General Assembly and we decided to make Perfect.Match()! 

## Description 
Welcome to perfect match.

We are a job marketplace built for developers by developers.

Our service forefronts user skills in order to match with jobs that meet specific criteria.

We cut out the fluff.

You can update your skill set anytime by visiting the profile link.

## Technologies used 
* Django
* Python
* CSS
* HTML
* PostgreSQL
* Trello
* VScode
* Heroku
* Whimsical


## [Getting started ](http://example.com "Title")
Log into the website with google by clicking the Google icon, and then you are free to do whatever you want in the website, create items, remove your own items, buy other peoples items, almost anything! (Note that the cart and new items link will not work unless signed in)

## Original Wireframe and Planning 
* [Lucid](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/b87764aa-07e5-4e65-9341-7701001a847a/edit?page=0_0&invitationId=inv_7ba32e97-945c-4498-a69b-35dbcc0eaa2d#)

## Wins 
One major win from this project was being able to implement full CRUD (Create Read Update Delete), I was able to accomplish at least one of each CRUD function.

Another win from this project was being able to implement googles OAuth, this was something I thought was going to be very difficult however it was not as big a problem as I had anticipated, albeit it was still difficult.

## Hurdles 
The single largest hurdle that I faced in this project was being able to take items from one page and move them to another page while simultaneously moving them from one object to another. 

Some other smaller hurdles were the sheer amount of bugs that I had, for every function I implemented there were countless bugs. Each function required extremely thorough testing to make sure It worked properly

## Next Steps 
There are multiple things that I plan on implementing and these include 
* A range finder so you can see items in your area
* Adding the ability to upload an image of your item listed 
* The ability to purchase items with real currency
