# Project-3
This is our third project at General Assembly and we decided to make Perfect.Match()! 

## Description 
Welcome to perfect match.

We are a job marketplace built for developers by developers.

Our service forefronts user skills in order to match with jobs that meet specific criteria.

We cut out the fluff.

You can update your skill set anytime by visiting the profile link.

* [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/crud-grand-garage-4KdaPAfvXYjCUS8wwc8yUG)

## Wins 
One major win from this project was being able to implement full CRUD (Create Read Update Delete), we were able to accomplish at least one of each CRUD functions.


## Hurdles 
There were countless hurdles with the project. Almost every function we wrote that went beyond the basics functions would lead to a multitude of errors that ended with us refactoring almost all of our code. However we were able to get all the functions working in the end even if they were all seemingly impossible.

## Next Steps 
There are multiple things that I plan on implementing and these include 
* Moving Api into a second folder that way we dont have to import views to use it 
* Adding the ability to remove jobs from saved
